Comes with MoarTL, a tiny bootstrapped programming language like NQP,
but specific to MoarVM, less perlish and even more low-level.

NOTE:   All of this is work in progress. Currently, only a few bits and
        pieces have been implemented, and nothing has been finalized yet.


moaras - assembler targetting MoarVM bytecode, written in NQP
  Usage:
    moaras <src> <dest>
    moaras -x [<src> ...]
    moaras --dump [<src>]
    moaras --run [<src>] [<args> ...]

moardis - disassembler for MoarVM bytecode, written in MoarTL [TODO]

moartl0 - stage 0 compiler for MoarTL, written in Perl 6
  Usage:
    moartl0 [<src> ...]
    moartl0 --run <script> [<args> ...]
    moartl0 --compile <src> [<dest>]

moartl - compiler for MoarTL, written in MoarTL [TODO]


Eample Usage:
    ./moartl0 --compile t/hello.tiny && moar t/hello.moarvm
    MOARTL_ECHO=1 ./moartl0 --run t/loop.tiny
