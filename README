Comes with MoarTL, a tiny (and eventually bootstrapped) programming language
like NQP, but specific to MoarVM, less perlish and even more low-level.

NOTE: All of this is work in progress. Currently, only a few bits and pieces
      have been implemented, and nothing has been finalized yet.


moaras - assembler targetting MoarVM bytecode, written in NQP
  Usage:
    moaras --parse|-p [<src>]
    moaras --dump|-d [<src>]
    moaras --compile|-c <src>
    moaras --compile-to=<Str> [<src>]
    moaras --run|-r [<src>]


moardis - disassembler for MoarVM bytecode, written in MoarTL [TODO]


moartl0 - stage 0 compiler for MoarTL, written in Perl 6
  Usage:
    moartl0 --parse|-p [<src>]
    moartl0 --dump|-d [<src>]
    moartl0 --compile|-c <src>
    moartl0 --compile-to=<Str> [<src>]
    moartl0 --run|-r [<src>]


moartl - compiler for MoarTL, written in MoarTL [TODO]
